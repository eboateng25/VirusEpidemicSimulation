# Project Overview
In this project, we as a collective set out to create a program that could simulate to a relative degree of accuracy, the ects, process and results of epidemic in a closed population. The program is prompted by several user inputs that change simulation outcomes in a pseudo realistic way. Its use was intended for medical professionals and virologists that needed a simple software that could approximately calculate the outcomes and spread of any new or pre-existing virus.  
### **User Agreement & EULA:**
The following user manual is intended for medical professionals and certified virologists. The software is simulating the outcomes of a virus based on rigid formulae and estimations.  User discretion is advised as results must be interpreted with caution. Please note, that by using the our software; you agree to the following:

- The software is to be used  as an estimation/speculative result. All resultant data should be interpreted with caution; professional supervision is advised.
- The software results mustn’t be used as any factual basing. It cannot be referenced as a form of evidence.
- The software can not be distributed to the third-party. All copies must be acquired directly from the developers; pirated softwares may lead to inaccurate results from the software..
- Any publication of the softwares result must be withdrawn as fraudulent unless peer-reviewed.

# System Requirements:
**OS:** Windows 10, Mac OS, Linux.

**Processor:** 2.3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or better.

**Memory:** 512 MB RAM.

**Graphics:** DirectX 9 compatible video card with at least 512MB of VRAM.

**DirectX:** Version 9.0.

**Storage:** 5 GB available space.

Please note that the program mentioned is running Java 11.0. All systems that wish to run the program must have an adequate Java SDK & JDK installed to ensure the program runs smoothly. The system requirements above are used as minimum requirements to start the program. Depending on the input size of the simulation, the program may not run properly as resources will be consumed.
